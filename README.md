#Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv8 (Webcam)

This project performs real-time object detection using a webcam with YOLOv8, OpenCV, and cvzone. It detects 80 common objects (COCO dataset) such as people, cars, animals, and everyday items, displaying bounding boxes, class names, confidence scores, and FPS.
